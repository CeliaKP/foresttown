this was my first time using procreate, ren'py, and vscode for real. i hope you have a lot of fun playing this game!!

features: 
  -cute and loveable woodland animals!
  -customize the fox's name! (or have the game choose it for you)
  -choose your favorite artist! (or leave the guesswork to the game!)
  -an evil bunny! 
  -drawn background (with procreate) inspired by photos of the redwood national park!
  -suspense! (not really but there are ...)
  -downloadable in windows, mac, and linux
future iterations: 
  -custom gui!
  -more choices in the game 
  -more time spent with other characters
  -audio
  -animation
  -more characters
things i learned: 
  -you must stage changes in vscode before committing 
  -not all coding tutorials are great 
  -you have to make sure the size of the image in procreate/really anything is not too big (look at my commits lol)
  -adjusting in ren'py can be a little tedious (again, look at my commits) 
  -commiting can be fun and very not fun at the same time 
  -and a lot of other stuff too

i hope you have lots of fun and stick around for more!!
